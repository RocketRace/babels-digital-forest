                        one of the 88x31s on the internet plus more! You can scroll the
                        page to see all of them. Sorry that they're in a bit of a
                        jumbled order :/ There were too many for me to curate... Look
                        around and you might find your own 88x31 in here! Share this
                        website with your friends if you like it :-)

                            Jorge Luis Borges' short story <em>The Library of Babel</em> is well known for its depiction
                            of the infinite library. It conceives a world consisting of a seemingly endless array of
                            bookshelves containing every single combination of letters that can fit in a book — but the
                            books are ordered randomly throughout the library. The inhabitants of the library, being
                            human, can only explore the megastructure one room at a time. <em>The Library of Babel</em> is also
                            well known for its internet adaptation at https://libraryofbabel.info. It is a
                            straightforward projection of the original world into a digital medium, with some added
                            features more suited for a website.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Library taps into the concept of curated knowledge, in particular the desire to curate
                            and collect more and more information. Perhaps this form of knowledge-gathering is part of
                            the human condition, part of our desire to understand the world around us. We have shared
                            oral traditions and documented our knowledge for as long as those methods have existed to
                            us. A library in particular has a specific philosophical implications regarding knowledge.
                            It implies intent in the collection and organization of information. This is ironic, even
                            humorous when juxtaposed with the random unfiltered approach to knowledge contained in the
                            Library. But could the concept of <em>The Library of Babel</em> be brought to the internet in a less
                            direct way?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Nowadays, the internet has given light to a new kind of information. Our every message and
                            interaction online increasingly leaves traces and sends ripples across networks. We produce
                            a monumental amount of this data, more than is possible to analyze with a single mind. The
                            tech industry calls this "big data" (though that specific term exists largely for the profit
                            of big tech companies, a shareholder hype bubble much like what "metaverse" is/was).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            But even before the hypercommercialization of our online interactions, we have created
                            digital traces of ourselves and our relationships. A link on a webpage is an example of such
                            traces. Two webpages linking to each other creates a conceptual connection between two nodes
                            in a graph. These networks of relationships were a new kind of data at the center of the
                            early internet.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The 88x31 is perhaps the most iconic symbol of this early-web graph-building. Popular in
                            Geocities (and trending recently), 88x31s are small banners (88 by 31 pixels in size, hence the name) that you
                            can place on a website and use to link elsewhere. Pages can create unique banners to represent
                            themselves and thus to build an interconnected network of sites across the internet.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Like a universal library, there have been attempts to compile repositories of 88x31s across
                            the years. Perhaps the most impressive of them is https://eightyeightthirty.one/, which
                            displays a graph visualization of the links in question. Of course, such a feat is nigh
                            impossible, due to the sheer scale of the internet and its rapid evolution. Not every page
                            is reachable within the network, and there are bound to be isolated pockets of sites that
                            don't get picked up by the webscraper. However, these attempts are very impressive and
                            served as inspiration for this page, <em>Babel's Digital Forest</em>. Because what if the collections
                            of 88x31s <em>could</em> be universal? What would it look like to have a "god's eye" perspective on
                            the whole internet?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Ironically, we do already have groups with such a god's eye perspective of the internet. Our
                            digital lives are increasingly being controlled by a small handful of companies like Google,
                            Microsoft, and Meta née Facebook. Their motive is to drive online interaction into their
                            platforms, which are entirely within their control. The data that we produce is funnelled
                            into massive databases and piped into monstrously complex algorithms to generate data
                            insights, tailor content, and (most importantly) sell ads.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Taken in a different less depressing direction, one might reach this page. <em>Babel's Digital
                            Forest</em> is a projection of the spirit of the Library translated to the internet, without
                            retaining its medium. It's an extrapolation of the desire to curate to the uncuratable mass
                            of the internet, communicated using the aesthetics of Web 1.0. Every single 88x31 ever made
                            is here on the page at your fingertips. The tradeoff, of course is the same as that of the
                            Library: it is impossible to find coherent information from the Forest that you don't
                            already know.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The finitude of the Library is subtle in its original formulation. By virtue of being <em>inside</em>
                            it, forced to take on the perspective of an ant, your perception of scale grows. A single
                            human lifespan is quite strictly bounded, and the library is placed within the physical
                            realm. Thus, the Library creates a <em>tangible</em> representation of unreachableness. For all
                            practical purposes it is infinite.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            But the Library is, at least as described, only able to contain a finite number of unique
                            books. The precise size of the alphabet varies between 20 and 30 per interpretation and
                            adaptation, but stays finite. A page must in turn also contain only finitely many characters
                            (around 3000 is sensible). Finally, a book can only have finitely many pages (400?). Putting
                            all this together, we find that there are (alphabet size) ^ (chars per page * pages per
                            book) unique permutations of letters (i.e. books) — a far cry from infinity!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            (As a side note, the web version of the Library only contains every unique <em>page</em> containing
                            3200 characters rather than every 400-ish-page book of such pages. I assume this is for
                            technical reasons, but this does mean that it only contains 29^3200 unique pages of text...
                            which is less than the number of banners on this page. In fact, an 88x31 can store the same
                            amount of information as about 4 pages of text! An image indeed says more than a thousand
                            words.)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The tension between the finite and infinite comes from how we are able to interface with the
                            library. As a lone wanderer inside a megastructure, one's only option is to traverse the
                            hallways. The books one is able to read, or even to reach, are but a drop in an ocean
                            compared to the vastness of the whole library, finite or not. One's search for hidden
                            knowledge is doomed from the start, for the likelihood of finding any coherent text is
                            infinitesimal — much less text that communicates information beside entropy.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the online version of the Library, we are given additional means of interacting with the
                            Library. We can locate a book by its position, eschewing the need for physical traversal. We
                            can also jump directly to a random position, as if whisked away by reality. Finally, we are
                            able to search for the precise location of specific sequences of characters, effectively
                            allowing us to recall books we know to exist in the Library.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Notably, these extra methods do not allow us to gain any more knowledge from the digital
                            Library that the physical Library didn't offer. While we are able to find more instances of
                            coherent text (simply by searching for it), we are not able to find any information that was
                            not provided by us in the first place. Jumping to a random or specific coordinates is no
                            good, either — since there's no pattern to the contents of a book at a coordinate, every
                            turned page is equally likely to contain a prayer. Thus, the theoretical inaccessibility of
                            the Library is maintained.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            However, these additional capabilities introduce tension between the apparent infinitude and
                            the theoretical finitude of the Library. When jumping between locations, we are no longer
                            acting from <em>within</em> the Library, but rather <em>outside</em> it. The physical metaphor of the Library
                            begins to break apart as soon as we are able to transcend physical barriers and jump to
                            arbitrary points within. The Library becomes a <em>thing</em> to be interacted with, rather than an
                            environment to traverse. The medium of a webpage promotes the former kind of interaction.
                            Nevertheless, it does not necessarily imply bounds on the Library as a thing. We only see a
                            snapshot of the Library at any given point in time and thus are not privy to the size,
                            outside of calculations like those above.

                            So what if this tension was then taken further? What if it was faster and simpler to
                            traverse the Library? What if the finitude of the Library was displayed to you at every
                            moment? What if you were presented with an abstraction of the entire Library visible at
                            once? These questions helped drive the development of this page. In <em>Babel's Digital Forest,</em>
                            I hoped too push those borders further, through the single continuous scrollable page, the
                            speed at which you can zoom through 88x31s, the progress bar in the footer, and the general
                            presentation of the site. By adding additional features, I wanted to inch the bar of tension
                            further without breaking the moment. Though despite these features, the smallness of the
                            Forest is illusory. The progress bar in all its 13 decimal digits of precision will never
                            tick as a result of scrolling (you'd need almost 20000 significant digits to see it change
                            in real time).

                        <p>
                            In the end, I found myself being drawn towards the metaphor of the forest. A forest and a
                            galaxy are cute comparisons to draw here. They are infinitely complex (eco)systems with an
                            amount of detail that a single human could never fully internalize. They are systems that
                            follow sets of rules, even if they are not at first intuitive. They go on seemingly forever,
                            but do ultimately have some bounds. Both are beautiful. However, the emphasis on the
                            metaphor does detract from the aforementioned tension building. Embracing the idea of a
                            complex ecosystem to take a walk through hinders the thingification of the system. In the
                            end, I can't help but to leave my own imprints on my art.

                            By asserting a complete collection of anything, one claims finality. The Library contains
                            every book that could ever be written; hence any new books are simply copies of existing
                            ones. The Forest contains every 88x31 that could ever be linked to, hence every new 88x31 in
                            every website is already marked here. But human knowledge is not completable, and neither
                            are human relationships. We will continue to create novel content and forge social networks
                            for as long as there will be humans. The unreachability of these repositories is the point.
                            I find that comforting.
